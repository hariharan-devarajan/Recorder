2. Include the return value in each record.
3. Implement conflict detection algorithm for commit semantics and session semantics.

**Recorder 2.0.1** Nov 7, 2019

1. Implement compressed peephole encoding schema.
2. Intergrat zlib as another compression choice.
3. Users can choose compression modes by setting environment variables.

**Recorder 2.0** Jul 19, 2019

1. Add the binary format output.
2. Implement a converter that can output OTF2 trace format.
3. Write a separate log unit to provide an uniform logging interface. Re-write most of the code to use this new log unit.
