# Recorder 2.3

**A Multi-Level Library for Understanding I/O Activity in HPC Applications**

We believe that multi-level I/O tracing and trace data analysis tool can help
end users understand the behavior of their application and I/O subsystem, and
can provide insights into the source of I/O performance bottlenecks.

Recorder is a multi-level I/O tracing framework that can capture I/O function
calls at multiple levels of the I/O stack, including HDF5, MPI-IO, and POSIX
I/O. Recorder requires no modification or recompilation of the application and
users can control what levels are traced.



## Building Recorder

There are two ways to build and install Recorder. The first way is to build Recorder from source using CMake. This is recomended as Recorder is currently under active development.

### 1. Building Recorder with CMake (recommended)

**Dependencies**

 - MPI
 - HDF5
 - Arrow (optional) > 5.0.0 - Needed for building Parquet convertor.
 - CUDA (optional) - Needed for CUDA kernels interception.

*Note that Recorder and the applications you intend to trace must be compiled with the same version of HDF5 and MPI.*

**Build & Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uiuc-hpc/Recorder.git
cd Recorder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install location]
make
make install
```
**CMake Options**

(1) Dependencies install location

If MPI, HDF5, or arrow is not installed in standard locations, you may need to use `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to indicate their locations:
```bash
cmake ..                                                          \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install location]                   \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=[semicolon separated depedencies dir]
```

(2) Enable/disable tracing levels

By default, Recorde traces function calls from all levels: HDF5, MPI, MPI-IO and POSIX. The following options can be used to enable/disable specific levels.
 * -DRECORDER_ENABLE_POSIX_TRACE=[ON|FF]
 * -DRECORDER_ENABLE_MPI_TRACE=[ON|FF]
 * -DRECORDER_ENABLE_MPIIO_TRACE=[ON|FF]
 * -DRECORDER_ENABLE_HDF5_TRACE=[ON|FF]

(3) Intercepting `fcntl()` call: 

Since v2.1.7, `fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ...)` is intercepted. The commands (2nd argument) defined in POSIX standard
are supported. If non-POSIX commands were used, please disable fcntl tracing at configure time with `-DRECORDER_ENABLE_FCNTL_TRACE=OFF`.

(4) Intercepting CUDA kernels:

add `-DRECORDER_ENABLE_CUDA_TRACE=ON` to cmake to allow tracing CUDA kernels.

(5) Parquet Converter

add `-DRECORDER_ENABLE_PARQUET=ON` to cmake to build the Parquet format converter




**Features Controled by Environment Variables**

(1) Inclusion/Exclusion prefix list

Many POSIX calls intercepted are made by system libraries, job schedulers, etc. Their I/O accesses are less interesting as they operates on
file locations such as `/dev, /sys, /usr/lib, etc`. To ignore those calls, you can specifiy a file that contains prefixes that you want to
exclude:

```bash
export RECORDER_EXCLUSION_FILE=/path/to/your/exclusion_prefix_file

# This file contains one prefix each line.
# An example exclusion prefix file is included with Recorder:

Recorder$ cat ./exclusion_prefix.txt 
/dev
/proc
/sys
/etc
/usr/tce/packages
pipe:[
anon_inode:
socket:[
```

Similarly, you can set `RECORDER_INCLUSION_FILE` to specify the inclusion prefixes, so only the POSIX calls that match those prefixes will be recorded.

Note that this feature only applies to POSIX calls. MPI and HDF5 calls are always recorded when enabled.

(2) Storing pointers

Recorder by default does not log the pointers (memory addresses) as they provide little information yet
cost a lot of space to store.
However, you can change this behaviour by setting the enviroment variable `RECORDER_LOG_POINTER` to 1.

(3) Storing thread ids

Use `RECORDER_LOG_TID`(0 or 1) to control whether to store thread id. Default is 1.

(4) Storing call levels

Use `RECORDER_LOG_LEVEL` (0 or 1) to control whether to store call levels. Default is 1.

(5) Location to write traces:

By default Recorder will output the traces to the current working directory.
You can use the enviroment variable `RECORDER_TRACES_DIR` to specifiy the path where you want the traces stored.
Make sure that every process has the persmission to write to that directory. 

(6) Buffer size

Timestamps are buffered internally to avoid frequent disk I/O. Use `RECORDER_BUFFER_SIZE` (in MB) to set 
the size of this buffer. The default value is 1MB.


### 2. Building Recorder with Spack

*NOTE: please do not use Spack to install Recorder for now. The version there is outdated, we will update it soon.*

For now, building Recorder with Spack provides less flexibility. We will add the CMake options for spack as well.

```bash
spack install recorder
```
By default Recorder generates traces from all levels, you can use **~** to disable a specific level.

E.g., the following command will install Recorder with HDF5 and MPI tracing disabled.
```bash
spack install recorder~hdf5~mpi
```

## Usage

Assume `$RECORDER_ROOT` is the location where you installed Recorder.

**1. Generate traces**

```bash
# For MPI programs
mpirun -np N -env LD_PRELOAD $RECORDER_ROOT/lib/librecorder.so ./your_app

# For non-MPI programs or programs that may spwan non-mpi children programs
RECORDER_WITH_NON_MPI=1 LD_PRELOAD=$RECORDER_ROOT/lib/librecorder.so ./your_app
```
mpirun can be changed to your workload manager, e.g. srun.

The trace files will be written to the current directory under a folder named `hostname-username-appname-pid-starttime`. 

*Note: In some systems (e.g., Quartz at LLNL), Darshan is deployed system-widely. Recorder does not work with Darshan. Please make sure darhsn is disabled and your application is not linked with the darshan library (use ldd to check).*

**2. Human-readable traces**

Recorder uses its own binary tracing format to compress and store traces.

We provide a tool (recorder2text) that can convert the recorder format traces to plain text format.
```bash
$RECORDER_ROOT/bin/recorder2text /path/to/your_trace_folder/
```
This will generate text fomart traces under `/path/to/your_trace_folder/_text`.

<!---
**3. Post-processing**

We provide a Python library, [recorder-viz](https://pypi.org/project/recorder-viz/), for post-processing tasks.

It can be used to automatically generate detailed visuazation reports, or can be used to directly access the traces information. 
-->


## Post-processing and Visualization

**1. recorder-viz**

We developed a Python library, [recorder-viz](https://github.com/wangvsa/recorder-viz), for post-processing and visualizations.
Once installed, run the following command to generate the visualization report.
```bash
python $RECORDER_DIR/tools/reporter/reporter.py /path/to/your_trace_folder/
```
**2. Format Converters**

We also provide two format converters `recorder2parquet` and `recorder2timeline`. They will be placed under $RECORDER_ROOT/bin directory after installation.

- `recorder2parquet` will convert Recorder traces into a single [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) formata file. The Apache Parquet format is a well-known format that is supported by many analysis tools.

- `recorder2timeline` will conver Recorder traces into [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/trace-event-reading) trace format files. You can upload them to [https://ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev) for an interactive visualization.

**3. C APIs**

TODO: we have C APIs (tools/reader.h). Need to doc them.


## Dataset

[Traces from 17 HPC applications](https://doi.org/10.6075/J0Z899X4)

The traces were collected using an old version of Recorder. The current version uses a different trace format.
To read those traces please use Recorder 2.2.1 from the [release](https://github.com/uiuc-hpc/Recorder/releases/tag/v2.2.1) page.
