# Recorder 2.4

**A Multi-Level Library for Understanding I/O Activity in HPC Applications**

We believe that multi-level I/O tracing and trace data analysis tool can help
end users understand the behavior of their application and I/O subsystem, and
can provide insights into the source of I/O performance bottlenecks.

Recorder is a multi-level I/O tracing framework that can capture I/O function
calls at multiple levels of the I/O stack, including HDF5, MPI-IO, and POSIX
I/O. Recorder requires no modification or recompilation of the application and
users can control what levels are traced.
